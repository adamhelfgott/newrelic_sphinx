Disabling and uninstalling
Questions to consider:

Are there other dependencies before disabling or uninstalling the plugin? For example, are there any special procedures your plugin users need to know in order to have their operating system stop the process from running, so that they can remove components (instances) from their installed plugin?
Can you temporarily disable and then re-enable the plugin (for example, for troubleshooting or updating it), or must you completely uninstall and reinstall?
Can the uninstall procedure be done from a command line?
